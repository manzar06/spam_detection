Spam Email Detection System

(Python-Based – Without Machine Learning)


---

1️⃣ Project Title

Rule-Based Spam Email Detection System Using Python


---

2️⃣ Project Description

Spam emails are unwanted messages that often contain advertisements, fake offers, or malicious links. Instead of using machine learning, this project uses a rule-based and keyword-matching approach to detect spam emails.

The system analyzes the content of an email and checks for:

Spam keywords

Suspicious links

Excessive capital letters

Repeated special characters


Based on predefined rules and scores, the email is classified as Spam or Not Spam (Ham).


---

3️⃣ Objectives

To detect spam emails without using ML algorithms

To design a lightweight and fast spam filter

To understand text processing in Python

To improve email safety using logical rules



---

4️⃣ Scope of the Project

Suitable for medium-level Python CSE projects

No need for large datasets or training

Can be extended to:

SMS spam detection

Chat message filtering

Email client integration

7️⃣ Module Description

🔹 Module 1: Email Input Module

Accepts email content from:

Text file

User input

GUI form




---

🔹 Module 2: Text Preprocessing Module

Convert text to lowercase

Remove punctuation

Remove extra spaces

Normalize text for analysis



---

🔹 Module 3: Keyword Matching Module

Predefined spam keywords list:

free, win, offer, prize, click here, urgent, money

Counts number of spam keywords in email



---

🔹 Module 4: Rule-Based Analysis Module

Rules include:

Presence of suspicious URLs (http, www)

Excessive capital letters

Too many exclamation marks

Repeated spam keywords


Each rule adds to a spam score.


---

🔹 Module 5: Decision Module

If spam score > threshold → Spam

Else → Not Spam



---

8️⃣ Algorithm (Step-by-Step)

1. Read email content


2. Preprocess text


3. Initialize spam score = 0


4. Check for spam keywords


5. Check for URLs and symbols


6. Apply rules and increase score


7. Compare score with threshold


8. Display result


things to consider --

dont use symbols like ai , use font awesome or some other for logo and icons 
readme report create in simple txt format only not like an ai md 
dont use the purple gradient for color use some other color combinations
